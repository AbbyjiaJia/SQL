Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+



# Solution 1:
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary


# Solution 2:
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary 
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)

# notes:
About the usage of limit and offset in SQL, we can refer to <https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-limit/>
1. Limit means the number of rows that will be returned
2. offset means skips the offset rows before beginning to return the rows. 
If you use both LIMIT and OFFSET clauses the OFFSET  skips offset rows first before the LIMIT  constrains the number of rows.
